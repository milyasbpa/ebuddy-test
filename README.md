# Step to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy frontend env files into frontend-repo folder and copy backend env files into backend-repo folder (environment sent on email).
PS: don't forget to rename these files 
.env.backend -> .env 
.env.frontend -> .env

3. Run npm install on 
- apps/backend-repo
- apps/frontend-repo
- packages
- also on the root folder
3. Run frontend project by 
- npm run dev and it will be served at port 3009
4. Run backend project by 
- npm run dev and it will be served at port 3001
If you want to act as frontend and build the backend you can run
- npm run build
- npm run emulator (to run firebase emulator, including firestore, and auth services)
- npm run start
